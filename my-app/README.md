# Gio Collazo's Fashion Design Website

## Why I Built This

This is a website I have built for a friend of mine. He is a Stylist in the Greater Los Angeles area and asked me if I could build him a portfolio website that is tailored to his needs. The purpose of this website is to demonstrate his prior work experiences and attract new clients to grow his business online.
