    <h2>Hello, I'm Giovanny Collazo!</h2>
    <p>Born and raised in Los Angeles, Giovanny Collazo is a proud Latino personal stylist whose passion for fashion was ignited in the early 2000s, inspired by iconic trendsetters like Nicole Richie, Paris Hilton, Mary-Kate Olsen, and Lindsay Lohan. Their fearless approach to style sparked Giovanny’s love for glam, beauty, and transformation. Immersed in LA’s vibrant nightlife and rave scene during the late 2000s, his bold, neon-infused aesthetic began to take shape—mixing streetwear with high-fashion edge and futuristic flair.</p>
    <p>In 2015, Giovanny graduated from the renowned “School of Style,” where he gained the foundation to launch a successful career in fashion. After interning with several top stylists, he carved his own path as a personal stylist, working everywhere from in-home closets to high-profile red carpets. Whether dressing clients for everyday confidence or spotlight moments, Giovanny’s mission is always the same: to help people look, and <em>feel</em>, like the best version of themselves.</p>
